«Island 84» is a digital platform on which the objects, photographs, and research materials that the Swiss ethnologist Felix Speiser brought back to Basel from his 1910-1912 trip to Vanuatu. The project aims to make the collection held in the «Museum der Kulturen Basel» and its documentation easily accessible and to encourage participation beyond the holding institution. By creating an interactive space, we hope to establish a foundation for lasting connections and future collaborations.
