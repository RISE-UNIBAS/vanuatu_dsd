Project 84 aims to make the collection held in the “Museum der Kulturen” and its documentation easily accessible. This platform is a digital inventory of the photographs and objects that the Swiss ethnologist Felix Speiser brought back to Basel from his 1910-1912 trip to Vanuatu.  By creating an interactive platform, we hope to establish a foundation for lasting connections and future collaborations.
