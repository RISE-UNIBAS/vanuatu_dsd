Between May 4, 1910 and July 1, 1912, Felix Speiser collected over 3,000 ethnographic objects and took around 1,500 glass plate photographs. Field diaries and notebooks from this period have been preserved. Numerous publications were published as a result of his journey. During his time in Vanuatu, Speiser never stayed in one place for more than three weeks and spent most of his time in missionary and trading stations. In addition to collecting, Speiser's research utilised other contemporary scientific practices such as anthropological measurements, anthropometric photography and the appropriation of human remains. The presence of missionaries, colonial officials, plantation owners and indigenous guides, who served as informants, prevented him from gaining the trust of Ni-Vanuatu and learning indigenous languages. As a result, the ethnologist had to rely on observations and the treatises of European authors.
