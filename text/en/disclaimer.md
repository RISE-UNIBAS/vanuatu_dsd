Visitors should be aware that this website holds historical data created in colonial circumstances, which may include vocabulary and views that today might be considered obsolete, inappropriate, and/or racist.

The collaboration envisaged in the project makes a platform in English indispensable. The research materials held in the Museum der Kulturen Basel and the collection documentation are in German; they will also be made available on the platform in this form.
